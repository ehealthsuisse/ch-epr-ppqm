== Suppressed Messages ==

# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem
# (And include comments like this justifying why)
# See https://github.com/FHIR/sample-ig/blob/master/input/ignoreWarnings.txt for examples

# Seems harmless
Code found in include, however: null

# Whenever the path is "StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[*].example[0].value.ofType(Identifier)", it is an error in the base specification and not in the PPQm IG itself
if identifier.system is 'urn:ietf:rfc:3986', then the identifier.value must be a full URI (e.g. start with a scheme), not 'Local eCMS identifier'
